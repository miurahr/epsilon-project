[Running EPSILON tests]

As of release 0.9.1 EPSILON has a test suite written in Perl.

1. Install required Perl modules

- Readonly
- Params::Validate
- Test::Exception

2. Install required external packages

- netpbm

3. Prepare at least one EPSILON build (generic, pthreads, cluster, mpi)
   using scripts from the tests/build directory of source tree.

4. Run tests

    prove -v tests/t/*.t

Some tests (e.g. verification.t) are very long and can take several hours to complete.
Each test (*.t) has a description in the begining of a file. You can check it out.

Your test reports either successful or unsuccessful are welcome.
